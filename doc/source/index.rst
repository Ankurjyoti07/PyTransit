PyTransit
=========

Fast and easy-to-use tools for exoplanet transit light curve modelling with Python.

Welcome to the PyTransit documentation! PyTransit is a package for exoplanet transit light curve modelling
that offers optimised CPU and GPU implementations of exoplanet transit models with a unified interface.

The first iteration of PyTransit was developed in 2009 to fill the need for a fast and reliable
exoplanet transit modelling toolkit for Python. Since then, PyTransit has gone through several
iterations, always thriving to be the fastest and the most versatile  transit modelling tool for Python.

The Mandel & Agol and Gimenez
models come with specialised optimisations for transmission spectroscopy that allow a transit model to be calculated
in multiple passbands with only a minor additional computational cost to a single passband.

The package has been used in research since 2010, and is described in Parviainen (2015), which also details the
model-specific optimisations and model performance.Contents:
